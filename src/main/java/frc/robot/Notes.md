Notes:
- Connecting to Roborio using FileZilla
   Host: sftp://roboRIO-3035-frc.local
   Username:lvuser
   Port:22
   Location of SysID Logs: /home/lvuser/logs 
- Without any PID, the arm should stay upright, basically sayign that the kg is good
- System.out.println("setting command."+ targetPosition.name()); <-- Use this to troubleshoot>
- Connect in Pathplanner with Robot: 10.30.35.2
- Color: 5V - Multi COlor; Strip/12V - Single COlor Strip
- CycleTracker: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html; https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/roborio-wpilib-logging/159434/17
- Drive Feedforward: kS - Increase until the robot very slowly moves forward (this means too much,so lower) Then kV until the robot goes forward the amount needed
- Constants for Motor
