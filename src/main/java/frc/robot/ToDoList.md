- Add IsEnabled Button to all!!!!!
- How to convert from rotation to distance and rotations through gears to get rotation
- Make all of the writes that are not necessary during a match be in a practice only writers (Helps prevent the likelihood of loop overruns): Instead of relying on the Driver, maybe make a universal switch to turn it all off
